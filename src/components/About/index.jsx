							Ambitious and passionate developer looking to develop his skills
							gathered in the Road to Hire program. My passion for tech began
							very early with the influence of my father, but I did not pursue
							this passion more deeply until the Road to Hire program where I
							developed myself profesionally and technically. The technologies I
							learned are going to be listed below this section.

							Another thing I am really passionate about too is music. I've
							always loved music, coming from a very musical family I always
							heard how difficult it was to set up music events, and that's what
							gave me the idea for my eCommerce website which is the project I'm
							most proud about.
